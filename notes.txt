Dependencies:
tesseract-ocr (OCR software - well-trained for English)
pytesseract (python wrapper for tesseract)
Pillow (Image processor)

Transformations made in pre-processing:
Black & Whited image - hoping to increase contrast between text and non-text -> Image loses too much info

Grey-scaled image - some parts more accurate, some parts less accurate

Idea:
Do our own training
